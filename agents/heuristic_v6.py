"""Heuristic v6 — heuristic_v5 + a forward-projection "brain".

This is our own reimplementation of the decision core that separates the public
~1000-1100 LB agent (other_adversaries/HEURISTIC1000.py) from our 970 hellburner
lineage. We keep ALL of v5's proven machinery — obs parsing, orbital geometry,
intercept/aim, sun-blocking, the per-planet combat sim (simulate_planet_timeline),
candidate generation (evaluate_frontline_strategy), the early-game DFS, and the
mode-aware reach (MAX_DISTANCE 38 in 1v1 / 30 in FFA) — and replace ONLY the
mid-game decision rule.

v5's mid-game was greedy: pick the single reachable planet of highest production
we can win, commit, repeat. That is myopic — no notion of the resulting board
position, and it ignores who is winning.

v6 instead does a 1-ply search over a global value function:
  1. forward_project(): project EVERY planet's (owner, ships) forward FWD_HORIZON
     turns at once — production growth, in-flight fleet arrivals resolved with the
     engine's simultaneous-combat math, plus "phantom" opponent launches (each
     live planet periodically flings a fraction of its surplus at its nearest
     non-friendly target) so we don't grab planets that get instantly sniped back.
  2. forward_score(): score a projected board LEADER-RELATIVE — our advantage over
     the single strongest opponent in ships + 5*planets + 8*production. This
     matches Kaggle's win condition (single highest score wins), which v5's
     absolute production heuristic does not.
  3. plan_midgame(): for each candidate capture/defense (concrete fleet orders from
     v5's evaluate_frontline_strategy), project the board WITH that action applied
     and keep the action with the best score gain vs doing nothing. Commit, repeat
     until no positive-gain action remains or the per-turn time budget is hit.

Everything is bounded by a soft deadline (SEARCH_SOFT_BUDGET) so the heavier sim
never risks the 1.0s actTimeout. v5's reinforcement pass still runs afterward.

v5/v2's bug-fixes (inherited) vs the original other_adversaries/hellburner.py:
  1. Removed the `viz.add_text(...)` debug call inside run_early_game.
  2. Removed the dangling `elapsed_ms = (time.perf_counter() - _t0) * 1000`.
